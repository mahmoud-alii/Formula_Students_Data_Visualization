 Data Visualization Prototype Software for Formula Students car's sensors...
 
 The prototype considers the data from the sensors are transmitted from the car by a RF module and then recieved by another RF module, then connected to an Arduino 
 connected to the laptop executing this software.
 
 I have worked on this software for the Formula Students Team "Arab Academy Motors" aka "AAM",
